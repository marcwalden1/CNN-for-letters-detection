# Handwritten Letter Recognition using CNNs  

## Overview  
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten English letters using the EMNIST Letters dataset. The dataset consists of 103,600 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) categorized into 26 classes (A–Z). The model is built using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers and is trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: EMNIST Letters dataset  
- **Size**: 103,600 samples (88,800 training, 14,800 test)  
- **Format**: 28x28 grayscale images  

## Model  
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation  
- Max pooling layers for feature reduction  
- Fully connected layers for classification
