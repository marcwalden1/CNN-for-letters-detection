# Character Recognition using CNNs  

## Overview  
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten English letters using the EMNIST Letters dataset. The dataset consists of 103,600 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) categorized into 26 classes (Aâ€“Z). The model is built using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers and is trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: EMNIST Letters dataset  
- **Size**: 103,600 samples (88,800 training, 14,800 test)  
- **Format**: 28x28 grayscale images  

## Model  
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation  
- Max pooling layers for feature reduction  
- Fully connected layers for classification  
- Categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
